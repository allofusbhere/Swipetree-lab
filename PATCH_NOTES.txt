SwipeTree Lab Full Bundle (rc1d)

What this includes:
- index.html — minimal anchor + label area + SoftEdit overlay markup with required element IDs.
- style.css — basic dark theme and overlay styling.
- script.js — Lab Patch r1 logic:
  * Loads existing label from /.netlify/functions/labels?id=NNNNNN on page load
  * Long-press on the anchor opens overlay pre-filled with saved values
  * Save sends POST { id, name, dob } to /.netlify/functions/labels and updates the page
  * Removes corner edit button if present (id: cornerEditButton)
- placeholder.jpg — only used if the real image (e.g., 100000.jpg) is missing.

Usage:
1) Deploy these three files (index.html, style.css, script.js) to your Lab site root.
2) Ensure your Netlify function is reachable at /.netlify/functions/labels (as you already tested).
3) Open index.html#id=100000
4) Long-press the image → edit → Save → reload → labels should persist across devices.
