# SwipeTree Lab — script.js (RC4 — Long‑Press)

**Date:** 2025-09-02 16:30:23

This build switches editing to **long‑press** (no double‑tap needed), fixes the iPad context‑menu issue,
and keeps the Netlify label sync + edge friction.

- Press & hold on the photo for ~600ms to edit (iPad/phone).
- Desktop: hold mouse down ~600ms or use right‑click.

## Deploy
1) Replace your lab `script.js` with this file.
2) Open your Netlify lab URL (e.g., https://elegant-panda-0f4cac.netlify.app/index.html#id=100000).
3) Long‑press the image → prompts appear; save; reload to confirm label shows.
