# SwipeTree Lab — Quick Wins RC1 (No-Edit Upload)

**Date:** 2025-09-02 15:00:35

This is a *drop-in replacement* for the lab repo core files so you **do not need to edit anything**.

Included:
- `index.html` — same structure but with **inline** edge-friction + anchor-centering helpers.
- `style.css` — unchanged behavior; quick-win CSS is injected inline in index.html.
- `script.js` — placeholder (safe). If your repo already has a working `script.js`, keep yours.

## How to use
1. Back up your current lab files.
2. Replace **only** `index.html` with the one in this ZIP. (You may ignore the `script.js` here if you already have a working one.)
3. Keep your existing `script.js`, `style.css`, `config.js`, `labels.json`, `spouse_link.json` etc.
4. Reload and test swipes on iPad: the page should not bounce, and the anchor should remain centered.

If anything regresses, restore your backup `index.html` and tell me what you saw — I’ll ship a targeted fix next.
