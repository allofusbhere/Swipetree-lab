# SwipeTree — v132-stable-2932596-a (Baseline Wrapper)

This package is a **clean baseline wrapper** for the SwipeTree lab. It preserves
the agreed file layout and version metadata so you can keep your workflow tidy.

> **Why a wrapper?**
> I don’t currently have access to your exact v132-stable-2932596-a byte-for-byte
> files in this session. To avoid shipping anything that could drift from your
> known‑good baseline, this ZIP intentionally includes **placeholder files**
> (commented stubs) for the app. Replace the three app files below with your
> verified copies to get an exact baseline build:
>
> - `index.html`
> - `style.css`
> - `script.js`

## Contents

- `index.html` — placeholder (no behavior, just a stub comment)
- `style.css` — placeholder
- `script.js` — placeholder
- `LICENSE` — MIT
- `README.md` — this file

## Versioning

- **Baseline tag:** `v132-stable-2932596-a`
- **Packaged:** 2025-09-02 14:42:37 (local)
- **Intent:** Byte‑for‑byte match of your known‑good baseline once you drop in your files.

## How to use

1. Unzip this package.
2. Drop in your *exact* baseline copies of `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`,
   overwriting the stubs here.
3. Zip the folder back up (or commit directly to GitHub) and publish as your
   lab start point.

If you’d rather I ship a fully working baseline directly (no placeholders), share
either **(a)** a public link to the GitHub repo/tag that contains v132-stable-2932596-a
or **(b)** upload your last known‑good ZIP here, and I’ll re‑package it verbatim.
